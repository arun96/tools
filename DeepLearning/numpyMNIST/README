Notes:

I get an accuracy of 86.38% (0.8638) when I train on all 60,000 examples, and an acuracy of 87.41% (0.8741) when training with just the first 10,000 examples.

In the submitted version, I randomly select 10000 images to train on, and then train on those. With this method, I score >80% the vast majority of the time, with a very small number in the 76-79% range.
