This is an implementation of reinforcement learning, in the cartpole game.

Notes:
I am using the following parameters:
- trials: 3 (as specified)
- episodes per trial: 1000 (as specified)
- moves: 999 (as specified)
- discount factor (gamma): 0.9999 (as specified)
- learning rate: 0.005 (as specified)
- layer size: 32

The layer size was determined using trial-and-error (the other values I tried were 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 64).

The code for initializing the TF graph is taken directly from the textbook, while the policy gradient training is based entirely on the pseudocode from the textbook.

The rendering call is commented out, but is located on line 82.

Bugs:
None that I know of.
