Notes:
On the development data, my model achieves a perplexity of 260-280.

I am currently using an embed size of 30, a hidden layer of size 128, and a keep probability of 0.85. The embed and hidden layer sizes were the initial values I decided on, and as the perplexity was low enough, I left them as is. The keep probability was determined through trial and error - I noticed that my model performed best with a probability of 1.0, but I wanted to prevent overfitting, so I tried 0.5, 0.75, and finally 0.85 (which gave me the best results).

There are no bugs to report.
